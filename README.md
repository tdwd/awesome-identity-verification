# Awesome Identity Verification [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of identity verification, KYC, AML, and biometric authentication resources — APIs, open-source tools, standards, datasets, and regulations.

Identity verification (IDV) is how online businesses confirm that a user is a real person and who they claim to be. It underpins **KYC** (Know Your Customer) in fintech, **age verification** in restricted commerce, **KYB** (Know Your Business) in B2B onboarding, and **AML** (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance everywhere money moves.
